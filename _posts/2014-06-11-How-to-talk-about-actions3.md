>Enjoying the little things 

>Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you kept hugging yourself mentally as you read? Have you ever seen a play or motion picture that was so charming that you felt sheer delight as you watched? Or perhaps you have had a portion of pumpkin chiffon pie,light and airy and mildly flavored,and with a flaky,delicious crust,that was the last word in gustatory enjoyment?

你是否曾经在读一本书的时候，因为这本书是在是太棒了，让你难以自拔？ 你是否曾经在看戏剧或者电影的时候，因为画面太迷人了，而感到了纯粹的喜悦？亦或是你曾经吃过一块特别好吃的南瓜饼，口味清淡，香气幽然，还有那薄薄脆脆又美味的外皮，真是最棒的味觉享受？


>Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of books that grip you emotionally, of plays and movies that keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense , or of food that satisfies a ravenous hunger.These would offer quite a different, perhaps more lasting and memorable, type of enjoyment. I have detailed,rather,mental or physical stimuli that excite enjoyable but not too sharply——a delightful novel, a charming play, a delicious dessert.

现在请注意我举的这些例子。我说的不是那些紧紧抓住你思维的书，或者是那些有着悬疑的剧情，让你惊心动魄的戏剧或电影，又或是那些能够满足你贪婪的饥饿感的食物。我说的那些东西，带来的是完全不同的享受，它们更持久，更难忘。我所描述的，是那些精神上或是肉体上的刺激带来的愉悦感，但这种感觉并不太剧烈——令人愉悦的小说，迷人的戏剧和美味的点心。

>How do such things affect you?          

> They titillate you.
