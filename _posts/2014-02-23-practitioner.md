**psychologist   心理学家**

> By education and training,this practitioner is an expert in the dark mysteries of human behavior——what makes people act as they do,why they have certain feelings,how their personalities were formed——in short,what makes them tick.Such a professional is often employed by industries,schools,and institutions to devise means for keeping workers productive and happy,students well-adjusted,and inmates contented.With a state license,this person may also do private or group therapy.
  
通过学习和训练，该执业者是人类行为方面的专家——是什么让人们做出这样的行为，为什么他们有这种感受，他们的人格是如何形成的。简而言之，是什么让他们如此表现行为。这类专家经常被工业界，学校和研究所所雇佣，来设计一些方法，保持工人高产而且快乐，学生很好的适应环境，居民满意。当持有该州执照时，这类人也可能去做一些个人的或者小组的治疗。

**psychoanalyst      精神分析学家**

> This practitioner is a physician,psychiatrist,or psychologist who has been specially trained in the techniques devised by Sigmund Freud,encouraging you to delve into that part of your mind called "the unconscious." By reviewing the experiences,traumas,feelings,and thoughts of your earlier years,you come to a better understanding of your present worries,fears,conflicts,repressions,insecurities,and nervous tensions——thus taking the first step in coping with them.Treatment,consisting largely in listening to ,and helping you to interpret the meaning of ,your free-flowing ideas,is usually given in frequent sessions that may well go on for a year or more.  

该执业者既是内科医生，精神病医师或者是心理学家。特别的是，他们学习的是佛洛依德发明的一些技术，帮助你深入你脑中被称之为 「潜意识」的部分。通过回忆你所经历的事情，精神创伤，感受以及你年轻时的想法，你就能更好的理解你的现在经历担忧，恐惧，冲突，压抑，没有安全感，神经紧张——从而走出克服它们的第一步。治疗的内容，很大一部分是倾听，并且帮你解释你那些自由流淌的想法。治疗通常会进行连续的几个阶段，通常需要一年或者更久。

**osteopath            整骨疗法家,整骨医生**

> This practitioner is a member of the profession that originated in 1874,what Andrew T.Still devised a drugless technique of curing diseases by massage and other manipulative procedures,a technique based on the theory that illness may be caused by the undue pressure of displaced bones on nevers and blood vessels.
Training is equal to that of physicians,and in most states these practitioners may also use the same methods as,and have the full rights and privileges of,medical doctors.  

这类执业者是起源于1874年的一种职业的一员，安德鲁·泰勒·史迪尔发明了一种通过按摩或者其他手法而不需使用药品就能治愈疾病的技术。这项技术基于这样一种理论，那就是疾病可能是由于错位的骨头，神经或者血管产生的不适当的压力所造成的。他们和内科医生受到的训练一样，在大多数的州这类执业者也会使用和其他医生一样的方法来治病，他们也有权这么做。
